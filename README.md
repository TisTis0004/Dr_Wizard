# Dr Wizard

**Dr Wizard** is a clinical helper calculator developed to support rapid and accurate execution of common medical calculations through an interactive interface.  
The project is intended to assist clinical and academic workflows by reducing manual computation time and cognitive burden.

> ⚠️ This tool is intended for educational and decision-support purposes only and must not be used as a substitute for professional clinical judgment.

## Overview

Dr Wizard integrates computational logic with a structured user interface to facilitate guided clinical calculations.  
The project is divided between calculation logic and interface design, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and ease of use.

The primary objective is to provide a lightweight computational aid rather than a comprehensive clinical decision system.
